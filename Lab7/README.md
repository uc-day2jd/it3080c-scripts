To run these scripts, you will need GraphViz and PSGraph downloaded.

To download GraphViz you will go to https://www.graphviz.org/download/ and download/install the latest windows version

Next, go to an elevated powershell window and type Install-Module -Name PSGraph

Accept all the prompts and type "Y"

You can now copy and paste these scripts in powershell or run these PS Scripts. I elect to copy and paste because it easiest for me. You can do them all at once!

I made a homemade python magic 8 ball this time around because I found it difficult to improve my calculator from project 1.
I wanted to try using a while loop for this project while also importing and using the random feature in python. 
This code is a continuous while loop while prompting for a question input. It will then output a random output taken from the real magic 8 ball in real life which is cool.

To run this code you will need python3. I recommend running this in visual studio code with the python addon.
Hit run in the toolbar without debugging and you will start your 8 ball adventure. It will continue to ask if you want to use it, and if you want to stop just hit enter.

I got help from python for beginners and added comments and 8ball prompts to spice things up a bit.

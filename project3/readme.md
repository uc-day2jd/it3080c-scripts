To run this script you will need an IDE or Compiler. You can use netbeans for example or any IDE that can compile java code. You can even use an online compiler. 

I chose to do Java this time because I am more firmilar with it as I took a whole class on the language. I decided that a game of tic tac toe could be the most complex thing I
come up with for this project. It uses case structures, try and catch, for loops, while loops, declaring variables and calling on java utilites. I sourced help for this project from 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tic-tac-toe-game-in-java/

It helped me create the board and gave me help on how to create some of the processes for the tic tac toe game. You will find comments I made explaning most of what
everything does.

You can copy and paste the code into the IDE or compiler and run the code. I recommend netbeans because that is what works best for me!

If you need any assistance on how to make the code work, contact day2jd@mail.uc.edu
